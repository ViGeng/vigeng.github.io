J\u00f6rg Ott at Chair of Connected Mobility, TUM, advised by Prof. Nitinder Mohan at SPEAR Lab, TU Delft, mentored by Prof. Dirk Kutscher at HKUST(GZ). My current research interests lie in Accelerating Critical Applications by Edge Computing and AI. Before joining TUM, I obtained my M.Phil. degree from HKUST(GZ), where I was luckily advised by Prof. Pan Hui, Prof. Gareth Tyson, and Prof. Dirk Kutscher. Previously, I was a full-time Engineer researching system performance optimization at Huawei and lucky to work with Mr. Jing Liu, Dr. Wei Wang, and Dr. Sui Zhou. I obtained my M.Eng and B.Eng from Fudan University and Harbin Engineering University in 2020 and 2017 respectively. I have internships in Alipay and eBay.</p>"},{"location":"index.html#-research-interests","title":"\ud83d\udcbb Research Interests","text":"<ul> <li>Edge Computing, Fog Computing<ul> <li>supporting critical applications latency-wise and efficiency-wise</li> <li>e.g., offload DL inference tasks from mobile/IoT devices to edge servers</li> </ul> </li> <li>Networked Systems<ul> <li>ML-enabled, e.g., ML-based task scheduling</li> <li>enabling-ML, e.g., distributed Inference</li> </ul> </li> <li>Programming Language Runtime and OS (@Huawei)<ul> <li>Golang runtime scheduler</li> <li>OS kernel optimization</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"index.html#-teaching--supervision","title":"\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Teaching &amp; Supervision","text":"<ul> <li>Master Practical Course: Edge Computing &amp; IoT (IN2106, IN4261) @TUM Chair of Connected Mobility<ul> <li>Winter Term 2025/26</li> <li>Winter Term 2024/25</li> </ul> </li> <li>Seminar - Hot Topics in Edge Computing (IN2107, IN4417) @TUM Chair of Connected Mobility<ul> <li>Summer Term 2025</li> </ul> </li> <li>Master/Bachelor Thesis/Guided Research/Internship Supervision @TUM<ul> <li>If you are interested in working with me, please feel free to contact me via email.</li> <li>You can also find a list of open topics from our chair here.</li> <li>Supervised Students:<ul> <li>Oguz Kagan Altas - M.sc.
